# Question8

This directory (question8) contains the implementation of the abstract data type (ADT) [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue), as well as a simple function to demonstrate its usage. That function, `sortArray()` sorts an array using a priority queue. The algorithm to do so is quite simple: 

- Put all elements of the array into the queue, 
- Remove element from queue and assign it to an element from the array, starting from the end of the array 

Note: The implementation of the priority queue is done using a linked list.
