# Question4

This directory (question8) contains the implementation of the abstract data type (ADT) [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue), using a heap.

Note: There's a simple program (main.c) that uses a priority queue in order to sort an array whose size and elements are given by the user through the command-line (CLI). There's also a Makefile as well as unit tests for the functions of the priority queue.
