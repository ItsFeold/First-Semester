# Question6 

In this directory (question6) exists the implementation of a simple sorting algorithm, namely the [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), for a list. The implementation has two functions: A simple function that inserts a node into a list in a sorted manner, and a the actual sorting function, which utilizes the former. The way it works is that, a new list is made, and we slowly add the nodes from the original list into the new one, now sorted. Then we simply update the original list.
